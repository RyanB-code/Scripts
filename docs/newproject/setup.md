# Setup

## Script Only

To use the script, the only requisites are that the `newproject` executable is in the same location as the `newproject-files` directory, as well as the `tasks-linux.txt` file inside the `newproject-files` directory is populated with whatever you want the default VS Code `tasks.json` file to be.

## Repository

Clone the repository to wherever you want it. This is not the place to learn how to do this.

```
git clone <url>
```
