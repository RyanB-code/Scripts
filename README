The purpose of this repository is for me to easily access scripts that I want to
put on any Linux distribution. 

For commands and their related directories, copy them together and place into the desired
location. Normally, this would be /usr/local/bin. 

Scripts are way easier to deal with than a fully fledged C++ project, and no need for
compilation on every desired machine.
